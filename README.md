# Kitchen Inventory App

## Overview

A Python-based tool to track yor pantry, automatically ingest recipes, suggest meals you can make, and alert you when stocks run low.

## Motivation

Keeping a well-stocked kitchen shouldn’t be a chore. This app eliminates manual recipe entry and helps you waste less food by knowing exactly what you can cook with what you have on hand.

## Project Structure  
- **data/**: sample recipe files and scraped dumps  
- **src/**: core modules (inventory, recipes, matching, alerts)  
- **tests/**: your pytest suites  
- **docs/**: design notes, API specs, planning docs  
- **.venv/**: your isolated Python environment (ignored by Git)  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository to your local machine  
2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`  
3. Activate the environment and install dependencies  
4. Point the app at your recipe source (JSON file, API key, etc.)  

*(You’ll fill in the exact commands here once you’ve finalized your stack.)*

## Usage  
- **Add an ingredient**: Provide name, quantity and unit.  
- **List inventory**: See what you have in stock.  
- **Import recipes**: Pull in new recipes from your chosen source.  
- **Find makeable meals**: Show all dishes you can cook right now.  
- **Threshold alerts**: Get notified when any ingredient falls below your set limit.  

*(Example command invocations to come once CLI or API is in place.)*

## Roadmap  
1. **Phase 1**: Inventory CRUD & basic matching  
2. **Phase 2**: Recipe ingestion (open dataset or API)  
3. **Phase 3**: Threshold alerts & notifications  
4. **Phase 4**: CLI refinements with argparse  
5. **Phase 5**: Optional Flask web UI  
6. **Phase 6**: Dockerization & deployment
